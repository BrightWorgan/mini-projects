          <h2>Being “Zero Waste”/ “Low Impact” in Dublin Airport</h2>
          <h5>My experience, January 27, 2020</h5>
          <div class="fakeimg" style="height:200px;">Image</div>
          <p>So, obviously travelling by plane is not “zero waste”, due to the environmental impact for airtravel etc., however I feel that one can travel as “low impact” while travelling by reducing one’s waste while in the airport and on the plane very
            easliy.
          </p>
          <p>Now both Terminal 1 and Terminal 2 in Dublin Airport have almost identical resources that one can avail of to reduce one’s waste. These are of course the free water staions, where one can drink water and refill water bottles, the recycling and
            compost bins, and also the vegan/plant based food options available in the food hall area.</p>
          <p>Terminal 1, as I was delighted to discover, has a small “Happy Pear” shop, (a famous vegan restaurnt chain in Ireland), with several breakfast and brunch options and all compostable packaging. While Terminal 2, does not have a similar all vegan
            option, there were options within some of the menus.</p>
          <p>In terms of pre-airport preparations, I would recommend bringing an empty waterbottle, a bamboo cutlery travel set, a smart device with apps intalled (like audible, spotify, netflix, and duolingo, and the app of what ever airline you are travelling
            with), so you can reduce the amount of items you are bringing with you such as books, ipod, and tickets as well as saving space in your luggage for other items such as clothes and if you are like me running gear!</p>
          <p>Many people who choose to live in a more “low impact” way tend not to buy new items or discuss buying items new. However, after over eight years my favouite travelling backpack, (that I bought scond-hand in a charity shop during my first year
            of university), fell apart, and so I decided to do some research into travel backpackks, and found the new “Osprey” backpack. I have now used it on four trips both in Ireland and abroad, and completely love it. I will say though, that I bought
            an expensive but good quality bag for myself because I intend to use this bag for many years to come, and not as a “fast fashion” piece.</p>
          <p>*Useful Tip* -Also please check with your airline before travelling if you can bring cutlery in your carry on bag, (my set is bamboo and was allowed) -Always check that your waterbottle is empty before going through security, (you can fill it
            up afterwards!)</p>
          <p>As always I hope this was useful!</p>
